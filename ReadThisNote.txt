The only thing that needs to be changed is in the bypassInstaller 

if (!bypass_installer->MapDriver("C:\\Users\\walter white\\Desktop\\driverx00.sys", "driverx00.sys"))

^^ just change the path to where the driver is located in my example its located in my desktop
as you can see from that string 

now just run Bypassinstaller.exe as admin then it will say bypass installed!
now just run usrx00.exe as admin and join your game (before you do that you need to wait 10 seconds!)
because battleye might flag you! 

and go  in usrx00 source and change everything to your target game 

important run the installer 1 time per restart.

the installer will map the driver + load the vulnerable driver! and clear some traces
